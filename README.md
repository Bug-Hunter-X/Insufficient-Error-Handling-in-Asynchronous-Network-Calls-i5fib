# Insufficient Error Handling in Asynchronous Network Calls (Dart)

This repository demonstrates a common error in Dart: insufficient error handling when making asynchronous network calls. The provided `bug.dart` file contains code that fetches data from an API.  The issue lies in the assumption of the API's response structure and the lack of specific error handling.

The solution, located in `bugSolution.dart`, enhances error handling to gracefully manage various scenarios, including network issues and unexpected JSON formats.  This illustrates the importance of robust error handling for reliable application behavior.
